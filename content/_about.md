I'm working on a PhD in computer science at the University of Southampton and I love solving problems with software!<!-- more -->
My research focuses on zero-shot collaboration of independently trained agents. The initial testbed is the collaborative card game Hanabi[^1], but the goal is to produce results which are widely applicable.

###### Things I've done

* First Class BSc Computer Science, University of Southampton
* Software development internship at JPMorgan Chase & Co, working on payments
* Research internship at University of Southampton in collaboration with Toyota, where I developed a novel algorithm for ridesharing allocation 
* Marketing consulting for small businesses and startups (tech)
