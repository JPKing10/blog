I'm currently a software developer at JPMorgan Chase & Co where I'm building a new internal product using Java Spring Boot, Kafka and Cassandra. <!-- more -->Following the summer, I will be starting a PhD at the University of Southampton where I'll be working on zero-shot collaboration of independently trained agents, initially focusing on the collaborative card game Hanabi.

In the past I've studied computer science and some mathematics[^1], developed a novel algorithm for ridesharing allocation in collaboration with Toyota, and spent time working with startups and small businesses to improve their marketing.
